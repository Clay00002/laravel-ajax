<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>"TOM!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"TOM!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>

  The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them  
    about the room; 
  then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom  
    or never looked 
  through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her  
    state pair, 
  the pride of her heart, and were built for "style," not  
    service—she could 
  have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She  
    looked perplexed 
  for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud  
    enough for the 
  furniture to hear:
</p>
<p>"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—"</p>
<p>
  She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down  
    and punching 
  under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to  
    punctuate 
  the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
